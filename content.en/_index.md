# ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

The web got too noisy. Everything feels heavy, rushed, and overly elaborate, even when the idea is simple. Somewhere along the way, writing and thinking took a back seat.

This site exists as a small, personal counterpoint to that. A place to write slowly, without the obligation to teach or convince anyone. Sometimes about programming and software engineering, sometimes just about what I'm trying to understand at the moment.

It's not a portfolio, not a manifesto, not a showcase. It's a public diary, simple and straightforward, made to organize ideas, keep track of what I learn, and leave traces of the path. Part of this also ends up in code — which lives over there: [github.com/breno5g](https://github.com/breno5g).

Feel free to look around 👋
